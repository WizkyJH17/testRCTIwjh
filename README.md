To users: Thank you for the test, it's quite complex for me because I never delve into these topics before, I like the test compared to other easier tests. Some of the topics aligns with my personal project, especially with the video player and compositional layout collection view.

Sadly it's not perfect due to time constraints, with more time I'd like to:
• update codes to follow SOLID principles
• redo the compositional layout collection view, i think the codes are longer then it should've been
• redo the manager, still need encapsulation
• try using combine instead of rxswift
• implement more unit tests

Thank you for checking the result.
Best Regards,
wjh

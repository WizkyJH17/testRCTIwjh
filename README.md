To users: Thank you for the test, it's quite complex for me because I never delve into these topics before, I like the test compared to other easier tests.

Sadly it's not perfect due to time constraints, wtih more time I'd like to update the codes to follow SOLID principles and clean up some mess, especially in the managers.
